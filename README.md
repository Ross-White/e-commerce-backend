## Description
My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
Steps to follow:
* Run 'npm install' to install modules
* Run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with data
* Run 'npm run start' to start the application

## Demo

The below vidoes demonstrate the functionality of the app.
